Motion Script is an animation tool for creating graphics with **TypeScript** and **HTML5 Canvas**.

This tool is heavily inspired by **MotionCanvas**, created by [Aarthificial](https://www.youtube.com/c/aarthificial).

I wanted to try and make something similar with my low knowledge of web development, to improve my skills and also serve as a portfolio for the future.

I am still in the early stages of development but intend to add support to multiple utilities for graph animations.

Stick around to see what time makes of **MotionScript**!
